### Hi, there 👋 My name is Lucian 🙃

I’m currently working at VTEX and learning a lot on how to work on a 24/7-always-on-highly-scalable-distributed-system platform. 🤓
I love having the power to build solutions from the ground up using the most advanced technologies available to humankind (using AWS). 🚀

**Reach me out** on **[LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/luciansturiao)** or **luciansturiao@gmail.com** and ask me about anything related to tech, software engineering, back-end engineering, scalability, AWS. 
It would be great to talk about those subjects 🌚  if it is not exactly that though, I am all ears 👁👃👁👂
